# Visualizing DC GAN training using Feature Extraction and t-Distributed Neighbor Embedding

This implementation is used to train a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network to generated images at different epochs which are then used by ResNet152
to be extracted of features and finally represented in lower-dimensional space using t-SNE.

If executed Google Collab/ Jupyter Notebook, simply run each cell to perform the implementation. If done locally, install the corresponding packages needed to use the implementation.

Insert the datasets to be trained by the DCGAN and ResNet152 with t-SNE in your local folder and change the directory path accordingly.
